		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<div class="page-break"></div>
		<div class="body-content">
			<p class="body-text">
				Hello, hello! I am <b>Lucky Clover Dev</b>, often referred to as <b>Lucky</b> or <b>Clover</b>!
				<br><br>
				I am currently a student working towards a degree in computer science! I am aiming to go into
				a career as a machine learning research engineer or data analyst. In my spare time I work on
				varying projects, going between web development, game development, and other projects as well.
				<br><br>
				I started the game studio <b>Housefire Studios</b> in 2017, a small team made up of my close
				friends. We're working on a game called <b>Shadow of a Doubt</b>, a metroidvania about a
				little wizard named Lumpia who saves the world and works through grief and loss. I hope to
				someday be able to fund my studio fully and work on our games fulltime.
				<br><br>
				So far, I have released smaller projects, such as <b>Tower Power</b>, <b>Inversion</b>, 
				and <b>Candlelit</b>!

		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<div class="page-break"></div>
		<div class="body-content">
			<h2>Why does the logo only have 3 leaves?</h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				This actually answers two questions at once! I started out as an artist, and when I realized that
				most artists sign their work, I realized I needed to come up with a signature. I spent a good bit
				of time rearranging my name and my initials to come up with something, and at one point saw that
				my initials made a shape similar to a three-leaf clover, and I stuck with it! When I started
				moving more towards a programming focus rather than art, my name changed from Lucky Clover Arts
				to Lucky Clover Dev, and it has stuck like that since!

			<h2>What game engine do you use?</h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				I have dabbled in a large number of engines! I've spent a lot of time in Unity, Gamemaker Studio,
				even Scratch, but of all of the engines I've used, the one that I am most familiar with and enjoy
				the most is the Godot Engine! It's very lightweight and easy to learn, and is generally very good
				for the 2D games that I focus on making.

			<h2>What art program do you use?</h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				Starting out, I used Piskel for a long time. Once I had the money, I bought Aseprite and have
				used it ever since!
